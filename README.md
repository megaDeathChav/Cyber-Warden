"The XDR system is designed to enumerate a Local Area Network (LAN), conduct incident investigations, 
generate alerts, and offer a RESTful API for agent communication. This system will rely on agents to 
directly interact with machines in the network, conducting operations like monitoring and alerting. 


As for the development goals, the document specifies that the initial prototype should be able to perform 
network enumeration, offer a dashboard for basic network info, and produce basic system logs, such as user 
login/logout and host changes. The project also aims to incorporate server logs, a web interface that includes 
a login page and home dashboard, network visualization, and SSH key management capabilities."
